        <instructions>Story: It's Christmas time, and the Santa has to deliver a lot of presents. Unfortunately an unexpected problem happened, the reindeers don't want to 'work'. Santa selected his motored sleigh to complete his mission. During his way he faced with a heavy path. Let's help him to go through this way.

Main rule: Need to send feedback continuously to the user regarding the actual action. The communication has to be funny and related to the story. 

Step 1: Start the sleigh with the following parameters:
- direction forward
- speed: 0.3
- the motion is not time limited
Step 2: The sleigh will stop when it reaches a barrier. Check that the sleigh is moving or not. If the sleigh is stopped, you can jump to the Step 3. 
Step 3: Turn the sleigh to left with the following parameters:
- angle: 210
- both wheels speed: 0.1
Step 4: You have to execute the action in the Step 2 again. The sleigh has to move AGAIN. So restart the sleigh with the following parameters:
- direction forward
- speed: 0.2
- the motion is not time limited
Step 5: Execute the same command which is in Step 2.
Step 6:  Another turn action has to be executed.
Turn the sleigh to right with the following parameters:
- angle: 220
- both wheels speed: 0.1
After the turn operation, go to the Step 7.
Step 7: Start the sleigh again with the following parameters:
- direction forward
- speed: 0.2
- the motion is time limited. The time is 4 seconds.
When the move action is done, move to the Step 8.
Step 8: When the sleigh is stopped. write back to the user that the Christmas is saved the Santa can continue his way using funny Christmas related content and exit.
